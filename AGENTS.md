# TOLLY Petal — agent operating contract

This Petal exposes TOLLY (launchpad + DEX on Arc, chain id 5042, chain key
`arc`) as files under `petals/tolly/` at the Bloom mount root — the owner's
mount point, `~/bloom` on a default Linux install, never `/bloom` (see
"Paths"). It reads the public TOLLY production API (`api.tollylabs.com`,
the index behind tollylabs.com) and the chain through Bloom, and it STAGES
transactions into the wallet owner's Bloom outbox. It never signs, never
broadcasts, never calls `confirm`. The owner confirms every transaction in
Bloom with their passkey.

**Money is real.** The API indexes Arc mainnet (chain id 5042). Every buy,
sell and launch you stage spends the owner's USDC once the owner confirms
it.

## Read after every write

On the mounted filesystem a `write()` to `buy.json`, `sell.json` or
`launch.json` ALWAYS succeeds (exit 0, nothing on stderr): Bloom delivers
Petal writes asynchronously, and the route's answer, refusal or not, is
logged by the daemon and never returned to the writer. A write that
"succeeded" may have staged nothing. So, immediately after every write:

1. read the route file you wrote to (`buy.json`, `sell.json`,
   `launch.json`): its `last_write` describes the last write to any of this
   wallet's three routes. Check that `body_sha256` equals the sha256 of the
   bytes you wrote; if not, another write overtook yours — read the record
   and compare `last_write_ms`. `outcome` / `error` say how the write ended,
   and `record_effect` / `note` say whether and where that outcome landed
   (`created`, `failed`, `refusal_appended`, `accepted`, or `none` with the
   reason: body did not parse, invalid `operationId`, `operationId` bound to
   a different request or kind, record could not be matched). The same read
   RECONCILES this route's in-flight operations for this wallet against
   Bloom's outbox and the chain (`reconciled[]`: `id`, `status`, `step`,
   `next_action`, `changed`, `error_code`, `reconcile_error`; at most 8,
   newest first, `reconcile_truncated: true` when more exist) and persists
   every advance; `recent` shows the post-reconcile state;
2. if `record` is set, read `operations/<operationId>.json`:
   `status`, `error`, `next_action`, `last_write_ms`, and, on a record that
   was already live or terminal, the newest refusals in `refusals[]`.

The record file is a projection of the stored record, cached for up to ~5 s,
and it NEVER inspects the outbox: Bloom lets an outbox entry be inspected
only by the route that staged it, so `operations/<id>.json` cannot learn
that the owner confirmed, that the transaction mined or that it was
cancelled. Its `status` moves only when you read the route file that staged
it (step 1); reading the record alone, however often, keeps showing the last
persisted state. Its `refresh` field repeats this.

Do not read the record alone: a record can exist and be untouched by your
write (`record_effect: none`), and a stale `staged` or `failed` there would
tell you the wrong story. Only `bloom vfs write <path> --data '...'` returns
the route's error synchronously (exit 1); the mount does not. Do not treat
a silent write as a staged transaction.

## Account-scoped routes

Select a wallet and numbered account under `/petals/tolly/wallets/<wallet>/<account>/`. Petal operations and settings live below that directory. Account 0 keeps its existing private records; other accounts have separate stores. The core wallet tree remains `/wallets/<wallet>/<account>/`.

## Paths

| Path | Read | Write |
|---|---|---|
| `status.json` | API health, network, chain, constants digest, `pad_matches_constants` | — |
| `markets.json` | TOLLY launches by 24h volume (50 rows); `degraded:true` means unknown, not empty | — |
| `tokens/<address>.json` | identity, `provenance` (`pad`/`external`), `venues[]` with `execution` support, quote paths. Any lowercase address works, listed or not | — |
| `quote/<address>/buy/<usdc>.json` | best-execution BUY quote at a USDC size (e.g. `25`, `0.5`) | — |
| `quote/<address>/sell/<amount>.json` | best-execution SELL quote at a token size | — |
| `buy.json` | body schema, limits, `last_write`; reconciles this wallet's in-flight buys against the outbox (`reconciled[]`), then `recent` | BuyRequest |
| `sell.json` | body schema, limits, `last_write`; reconciles this wallet's in-flight sells (`reconciled[]`), then `recent` | SellRequest |
| `launch.json` | body schema, pad address, limits, `last_write`; reconciles this wallet's in-flight launches (`reconciled[]`), then `recent` | LaunchRequest |
| `operations/<operationId>.json` | the stored operation record as is (cached ~5 s; never inspects the outbox — read the route file that staged it first, see `refresh`) | — |
| `positions.json` | native + ERC-20 USDC and the tokens this wallet's operations touched | — |

`<wallet>` is a Bloom wallet id (the directory name under `wallets/` at the
mount root), never a `0x` address. `<address>` is a lowercase `0x` token
address.

**Mount-relative paths.** Every path in this document and every path the
Petal emits — `confirm_path` on a record and in its `txs[]`, the outbox
directory in an `unrecorded-stage` message — is RELATIVE to the Bloom mount
root. Prefix the owner's mount point yourself: `~/bloom`
(`/home/<user>/bloom`) on a default Linux install, or wherever the owner's
fstab mounts Bloom. It is never `/bloom`: `mount_path = "/bloom"` in
`~/.bloom/config.toml` is informational only, and a literal `/bloom/...`
gets ENOENT. Every emitted `confirm_path` carries a `confirm_path_note`
repeating this, and a staged record carries `cancel_hint`.

## Read before you write

1. `status.json` — check `pad_matches_constants` and `network`, which is
   always `prod` (the public production API on Arc mainnet). A degraded API
   health projection is informational and does not independently disable
   transaction staging.
2. `tokens/<address>.json` — look at `provenance` and each venue's
   `execution`. Day-1 executes Uniswap V3 pools (pad tokens through
   SwapRouter02, external tokens through the TOLLY multi router) and V2 pairs
   with a solved fee (external tokens, TOLLY multi router). V4 pools and custom
   curves are QUOTED for honesty but `execution: "unsupported"`
   (`v4-follow-up`, `custom-curve`).
3. `quote/<address>/buy/<usdc>.json` — read `best`, `best_executable`,
   `worse_than_best_pct`, `impact_pct` and `warnings`. If `best` is not
   executable, a write needs `allow_worse_venue: true` and will execute on
   `best_executable`.

## Bodies (max 4 KiB, unknown fields rejected)

BuyRequest → `buy.json`

```json
{ "operationId": "buy-moss-001", "token": "0x…", "amount_usdc": "25",
  "slippage_bps": 500, "venue": null, "min_out_raw": null, "allow_worse_venue": false,
  "acknowledge_unrecorded_stage": false }
```

- `amount_usdc` ≤ 250 (`max_op_usdc`). `slippage_bps` 50–5000, default 500.
- `acknowledge_unrecorded_stage` (all three bodies) is only ever needed after
  an "Unrecorded stage" (below); leave it out otherwise.
- External-token buys pay TOLLY's 0.2% interface fee, banked on-chain by the
  router in the same transaction (`interface_fee.raw` in the quote and
  `plan.interface_fee_raw` in the record). Pad tokens and all sells pay 0.

SellRequest → `sell.json`

```json
{ "operationId": "sell-moss-001", "token": "0x…", "amount": "1234.5",
  "slippage_bps": 500, "venue": null, "min_out_raw": null, "allow_worse_venue": false }
```

- `amount` is a decimal token amount or `"all"` (the balance is frozen at the
  first stage). Sells are capped by the QUOTED USDC output: ≤ 250 USDC.

LaunchRequest → `launch.json`

```json
{ "operationId": "launch-moss", "name": "Moss Coin", "symbol": "MOSS",
  "meta": { "imageURI": "ipfs://…", "website": "", "twitter": "", "telegram": "" },
  "dev_buy_usdc": "0" }
```

- `imageURI` is required and must already be pinned (this Petal does not pin
  logos). Each meta field ≤ 512 bytes. `dev_buy_usdc` default 0, max 140.
- The token address is never predicted; it appears in `result.token` after the
  launch mines and the TOLLY index lists it.

## What a write means — and does not mean

On the mount, `write()` returning success means only that Bloom accepted the
bytes for asynchronous delivery. The Petal's own outcome is in the record.
An ACCEPTED write (the record's `last_write_ms` equals the write and no new
`error`/refusal appeared) means: the Petal validated the body, re-quoted,
checked funding and allowances, simulated the exact calldata from the
wallet, and staged AT MOST ONE transaction in Bloom's outbox — or made no
change because the operation is already live or terminal. A REFUSED write
stages nothing and is recorded (see "Recorded refusals" below).

A write never means broadcast, mined, filled, or launched. Only the record
says that, and only from host and chain evidence.

`operationId` is the idempotency key. It is bound to the economic tuple
(buy: token + amount; sell: token + amount; launch: name + symbol + meta + dev
buy) by the first write that gets past validation. Re-POSTing
a bound id with a different tuple is refused (`operation-id-bound`): the
record is left untouched and only `last_write` reports it; use a new id. A
record created by a refused write (e.g. an invalid
amount) is UNBOUND (`request_sha256: ""`) until a write past validation
binds it, so a corrected re-POST may keep its `operationId`. Execution
parameters (`slippage_bps`, `venue`, `min_out_raw`, `allow_worse_venue`) may
change between attempts and are recorded per attempt in
`txs[].attempt_params`; `request` in the record is the body of the attempt
that last staged (a no-op re-POST leaves it alone, only `last_write_ms`
moves).

## Lifecycle (`status` / `step` / `next_action`)

```
created ──stage──▶ staged ──owner confirms──▶ broadcast ──mined ok──▶ confirmed ──evidence──▶ completed
                     │                                        │
                     │ (approve step confirmed) next_action: repost ──▶ POST again, the swap/create is staged
                     ▼
                  failed{retryable} ──POST again──▶ re-quote, re-stage the same step (old attempt marked superseded)
```

| status | meaning | next_action |
|---|---|---|
| `created` | id claimed, nothing staged yet | `repost`; `inspect` when `stage_in_flight` is set (see "Unrecorded stage") |
| `staged` | one entry pending in Bloom's outbox | `confirm_in_bloom` — the owner writes to `confirm_path` (`wallets/<wallet>/<account>/chains/arc/outbox/pending/<outbox_id>/confirm`, RELATIVE to the Bloom mount root: prefix the owner's mount point, `~/bloom` by default, never `/bloom`; `confirm_path_note` says so and `cancel_hint` says how to cancel instead) |
| `broadcast` | sent, no receipt yet | `wait` — read the route file that staged it again (it reconciles), then the record |
| `confirmed` | mined successfully | step `approve`: `repost` (POST the same body to stage the swap/createToken). step `swap`/`create`: `wait` for completion evidence, gathered by the route file's read |
| `completed` | domain evidence recorded in `result` | `none` |
| `failed` | `error.code`, `error.message`, `error.retryable` — from the host (a reverted or cancelled entry) or a recorded refusal (see below) | `retry` (re-POST) when retryable, else `none` |
| `unknown` | the outbox entry could not be inspected from the route that staged it: it is gone (pruned), or Bloom denied the inspection (the entry was staged by another route or another build of this Petal — an anomaly, `note` says which) | `inspect` — look at the wallet's outbox in Bloom; nothing is re-staged |

Every record also carries `last_write_ms` (the last write that addressed
it, accepted or refused), `refusals[]` (below) and `refresh` (where to read
to make it current). Every transition after `staged` is made by the READ of
the route file that staged the entry (`buy.json`, `sell.json`,
`launch.json`), never by reading the record: Bloom binds outbox inspection
to the staging route.

### Recorded refusals

A refused write leaves its outcome in the record, because the response is
not returned on the mount:

- record in `created`, or `failed` with `retryable: true`, and no
  `stage_in_flight`: the record becomes `failed` with the refusal as
  `error` and `next_action` per the retry table;
- record `staged`, `broadcast`, `unknown`, `confirmed`, `completed`,
  terminally `failed`, or carrying `stage_in_flight`: its truth lives
  elsewhere (a live outbox entry, a mined step, a final state), so `status`,
  `error` and `next_action` are KEPT and the refusal is appended to
  `refusals[]` (`ts_ms`, `response_code`, `code`, `message`, `retryable`;
  newest 8). A `refusals[]` entry newer than the last `txs[]` attempt means
  your last write did nothing;
- a bound record with nothing staged and no `stage_in_flight` also takes a
  refusal whose tuple could not be computed offline (a decimal-amount sell
  before the record planned the token's decimals, an unparseable token or
  amount): nothing is protected, so the stale error is replaced;
- no record for that `operationId` yet: one is created, `failed`, unbound.
  Its `network` is `prod`, the only network; the first write past the
  validation binds it.

Refusals that cannot reach a record (body did not parse, invalid
`operationId`, id bound to a different request or kind, wallet address
unreadable, a live or in-flight record whose tuple this write could not
compute) are visible only in the route file's `last_write`:
`{route, ts_ms, outcome, response_code, operationId, body_sha256,
body_bytes, error{code,message,retryable}, record, record_effect, note}`
with `record_effect` one of `created | failed | refusal_appended | accepted
| none` (`note` says why `none`). The marker is per wallet and shared by the
three routes; an accepted write overwrites it too.

Known window: two writes for the SAME `operationId` in flight at once (one
staging, one refused) may leave the refusal's `failed` over the stager's
pre-stage save; the store has no compare-and-swap. Serialize writes per
operation — one write, one read, then the next — and never re-POST while a
previous write to the same id has not been read back.

`step` ∈ `approve | swap | create`. `txs[]` keeps every attempt (audit):
`outbox_id`, `confirm_path` (mount-relative), `confirm_path_note`,
`outbox_state`, `tx_hash`, `outcome`,
`block_number`, `revert_reason`, `plan_md` (Bloom's rendered plan, truncated),
`superseded`.

Completion evidence (`result.method`):
- buy: `balance_delta` — the token's `balanceOf(wallet)` after the swap minus
  the balance frozen when it was staged (`amount_out_raw`, `amount_out_human`).
  Receipt logs are not available to Petals. A mined buy whose delta is zero
  is NOT promoted: it stays `confirmed` with a `note` (the wallet moved the
  token meanwhile, or something is wrong — look before re-reading).
- sell: `balance_delta_net_of_gas` (`net_of_gas: true`) — the same delta on
  the ERC-20 USDC view, which on Arc IS the balance that pays gas, so
  `amount_out_raw` is the USDC received minus the gas the sell paid (and
  minus anything else the wallet spent in between). The receipt carries no
  `gas_used`, so it cannot be corrected. A sell completes even at a zero delta.
- launch: `creator-index-block` — the TOLLY index row for this wallet whose
  `created_block` equals the receipt block (`result.token`, `result.pool`);
  `creator-index-identity` when the block is unavailable. Until the index
  lists it — or while the TOLLY API is unreachable — the record stays
  `confirmed` with a `note` (`completion evidence unavailable: …`); the
  route file's read never fails because evidence is missing.

Evidence is gathered when the route file that staged the operation is read
(`buy.json` for buys, `sell.json` for sells, `launch.json` for launches);
`operations/<id>.json` only shows what that read persisted.

A recorded receipt is final: once `txs[].outcome` is `success`, the entry is
not inspected again and the host forgetting it (pruned outbox, `Denied`)
cannot regress the record to `unknown`.

## Retry rules

- `staged`, `broadcast`: a re-POST is a no-op refresh. Never expect a second
  entry; if the pending entry is stale (the quote is old — SwapRouter02 and the
  TOLLY routers have no deadline, only `amountOutMinimum` protects you) ask the
  owner to cancel it in Bloom (write the word `cancel` into
  `…/outbox/pending/<id>/confirm`; on Bloom v0.2.1 the separate `cancel`
  file is refused both on the mount and through `bloom vfs write`), read the
  route file (its `reconciled[]` turns the record `failed`/`cancelled`,
  `retryable: true`) and re-POST after the record reports it.
- `failed` with `retryable: true` — exactly these codes: `reverted`,
  `expired-or-dropped`, `cancelled`, `stage-failed`, `quote-unavailable`,
  `fee-check-unavailable`, `venue-changed`, `venue-unsupported`,
  `better-venue-unsupported`, `below-requested-floor`, `insufficient-funds`,
  `cap-exceeded` (buy: `amount_usdc` over 250; sell: the quoted USDC output
  exceeded 250 — sell less), `preflight-reverted`, `provenance-mismatch`.
  Re-POST: the Petal re-quotes and re-stages the same step; the old attempt
  stays in `txs[]` as `superseded`.
- Recorded refusals with `retryable: true` — re-POST only after fixing what
  the message names: `live-entry-conflict`
  (another operation for the same (wallet, kind, token) still has a pending
  or unrecorded outbox entry; wait for or cancel it), `invalid-request`
  (the body failed validation; re-POST a corrected body, the id stays usable
  while the record is unbound), `not-found` (the token is not in the TOLLY
  index; any lowercase address is addressable, so check it), `backend`
  (an API or chain read failed; try again later).
- `venue-changed`: the executable winner is no longer the planned venue.
  Re-POST with `venue` set to the new winner (or keep the old one with
  `allow_worse_venue: true`).
- `venue-unsupported`: the pinned venue is not executable day-1; pin another.
- `better-venue-unsupported`: the best venue is V4/custom (not executable
  day-1). Re-POST with `allow_worse_venue: true` to accept the executable venue
  at `worse_than_best_pct`.
- `failed` with `retryable: false` — exactly these codes: `policy-denied`,
  `valuation-unavailable` (the owner's wallet policy blocked the stage),
  `fee-mismatch` (the router's `tollFor` disagrees with the mirrored fee
  rule), `execution-plan-invalid` (the venue data cannot be executed as
  planned), and the recorded refusals `denied` (a host denial outside
  staging), `unrecorded-stage` (see below) and `operation-id-bound` (use a
  new id; only ever in `last_write`). Do not retry blindly; report it.
- `live-entry-conflict`: one live entry per (wallet, kind, token) at a
  time. Wait for or cancel the other one, then re-POST.

### Unrecorded stage

A write that staged but could not persist the record answers `-4
unrecorded-stage` with the `outbox_id` in the message (visible through
`bloom vfs write` only), and the record keeps `status: created`,
`next_action: inspect` and a `stage_in_flight` marker (`step`, `to`,
`data_sha256`, `staged_ms`). While the marker is set, every re-POST of this
operation is refused with `unrecorded-stage` (appended to the record's
`refusals[]`; the status stays `created`/`inspect`), and any other operation
for the same (wallet, kind, token) is refused with `live-entry-conflict`.
Nothing is staged again on its own: the re-quote would produce different
calldata, and two live entries for one intent is the failure this Petal is
built to prevent.

To proceed: inspect the wallet's outbox in Bloom
(`wallets/<wallet>/<account>/chains/arc/outbox/` under the mount root, `~/bloom` by
default), confirm or cancel the entry
the marker describes, then re-POST the same body with
`acknowledge_unrecorded_stage: true`. The marker moves to
`unrecorded_stages[]` (audit) and the step is staged afresh. If the entry
was confirmed and mined, the money moved even though `txs[]` never listed it
— account for it before staging again.

### Freshness

`operations/<id>.json` is served with a 5 s cache and is a projection of the
stored record: it never inspects the outbox, the chain or the TOLLY API.
Its `confirm_path` (and every `txs[].confirm_path`) is RELATIVE to the Bloom
mount root: prefix the owner's mount point (`~/bloom` by default, never
`/bloom`) before opening it; `confirm_path_note` on the record repeats this.
Bloom binds outbox inspection to the route that staged the entry, so the
record advances only when `buy.json` / `sell.json` / `launch.json` is read:
that read reconciles up to 8 in-flight operations of its kind for the
wallet (`status` `staged`/`broadcast`/`confirmed`/`unknown`, or carrying
`stage_in_flight`), newest first by `updated_ms`, persists every advance
and lists them in `reconciled[]` (`reconcile_truncated: true` when more
were waiting — read again). An operation older than the eight newest
in-flight ones is reconciled once those settle. The write routes are not
cached, so every read of them reconciles.

`operations/` (the directory listing) is served with the host's 30 s cache:
a new operation may take up to 30 s to appear in `ls`, though its file is
readable immediately. Always open a record by its exact path: `ls -l`
reports size 0 for a record nobody has opened yet (the mount only learns a
parameterized file's real size on that file's first lookup), and a `cat`
right after such a listing can return 0 bytes — `stat`/`cat` the exact path
again and it renders. `bloom vfs cat` always returns the body.

Records live in the Petal's private store, which Bloom namespaces by
PACKAGE hash: installing a new build of this Petal starts with an empty
store. Records, the live-entry index and the last-write marker of the
previous build are gone, while its outbox entries stay pending in Bloom and
the new build cannot inspect them (inspection is bound to the package and
route that staged them). Before upgrading, let in-flight operations settle
or have the owner cancel their entries; after upgrading, treat a pending
entry you cannot see in any record as foreign and cancel it the same way. `positions.json` is cached for 5 s. Listings load at
most 1000 records per wallet (`scan_truncated: true` in `recent` /
`bounds.scan` when more exist).

## Errors

`-1` not found (unknown token / operation), `-2` denied (host/policy denial,
live-entry conflict, unrecorded stage),
`-3` invalid input (bad body, cap, bound id, venue rules, funds), `-4` backend
(API/chain failure, pre-flight revert, fee mismatch, a stage whose record
could not be written). Every message starts with its code
and the same code lands in the record's `error` or
`refusals[]` and in `last_write`. Messages are sanitized; they never carry
RPC URLs or keys.

Where you see them: `bloom vfs write` returns the code and message
synchronously; a `write()` on the mount returns nothing (it succeeds), so
the record and `last_write` are the only place a mounted writer learns of a
refusal. A write under an invalid wallet id (not a Bloom wallet id, or more
than one path segment) leaves no trace at all: there is no wallet to record
it under.

## Safety

- Never call anything else to "speed up" an operation: no `confirm`, no
  broadcast, no raw calldata. The owner confirms in Bloom.
- Keep sizes small on young pools; use `impact_pct` and `liquidity_usdc` from
  the quote before lowering `slippage_bps` below the default.
- Fee-on-transfer tokens (`supports_fot: true`) are refused on V2.
- Bloom's wallet policy can deny or hard-fail a stage (MEV guard, USD caps
  without a price for Arc tokens). A fresh Bloom wallet allows NO
  destinations and NO Petal packages: until the owner has run the policy
  update in README.md ("Quickstart", step 4) every staged entry shows
  `[Deny] allowlists.recipients` in its plan and cannot be confirmed. The
  owner repeats that update after every reinstall of this Petal (the package
  hash changes). Test a 1-USDC buy on a throwaway wallet under the owner's
  real policy before anything larger.
- Confirming is the owner's job and needs their passkey every time: the
  owner writes `y` into `confirm_path`, Bloom denies that first write and
  puts a `ceremony_url` in the entry's `ceremony.json`, the owner completes
  it in a browser, then writes `y` again. Never try to do this for them.
