// The operation record, exactly as stored: a pure store projection under the
// 5 s account cache. It never inspects the outbox, the chain or the API, and
// never saves: Bloom binds outbox inspection to the route that staged the
// entry (tx_inspect compares the entry's execution origin, route id
// included, with the caller's), so reconciliation runs from the read of
// buy.json / sell.json / launch.json. A side-effecting spec would also render
// as an empty file on the NFS mount (st_size 0), so this must stay a plain,
// non-side-effecting read (see README "Host facts").
