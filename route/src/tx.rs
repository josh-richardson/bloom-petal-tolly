//! Staging helpers over `bloom:tx/outbox`.
//!
//! Every staged transaction is `value_wei: "0"` (all day-1 paths spend the
//! ERC-20 USDC view), `nonce: None`, and no fee overrides (critique M9: the
//! TxEngine sets EIP-1559 fees and estimates gas itself). The `eth_call{from}`
//! pre-flight is the mandatory revert guard before any stage: the engine falls
//! back to a 500k gas limit when its own estimate fails, so a bad calldata
//! would otherwise burn gas reverting on-chain.
//!
//! `tx_confirm` is deliberately never called (D12). Outbox confirms are
//! passkey-per-transaction by construction on Bloom v0.2.1: every confirm
//! mints a single-use Exact approval bound to {bloom-machine,
//! transaction.confirm} and requires the owner's passkey (bloom-tx
//! `tx_engine.rs` `triad_sign_evm_payload`, ~2864-2875 and ~3981-4006); the
//! local `agent_autonomy` branch is non-gating (~3527-3547) and
//! `bloom_proto::Policy` has no config loader, so no daemon setting turns a
//! confirm into an unprompted broadcast. A `tx_confirm` from this Petal would
//! therefore gain nothing, and with `acknowledge_warnings = true` it would
//! bypass simulation. The owner confirms by writing to `confirm_path`
//! (`wallets/<wallet>/<account>/chains/arc/outbox/pending/<outbox_id>/confirm`, relative
//! to the Bloom mount root, see `MOUNT_NOTE`).
